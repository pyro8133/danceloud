After almost three days of tests, I finally built a rudiment of my personal website. Now I decide to record my motivation and my operation as an archives.

Initially, I was wandering in a social media called coolapk, then I was caught by a title "..markdown...note...". As a person who was blank about programming, I took it for grant that it's a artical about how to "mark down" notes on several recommanded apps, so I clicked in and found a [external link](https://blog.skywt.cn/posts/seven-notes-and-wiki-systems-evaluation#toc_title5). With strong curiosity about everything unknown and a plenty of spare time, I browsed his blogs, after that I found a person commented below one of his blogs seemed outsanding and left me a little impression. After a while, I found their interactions below another blog which the blogger showed his admiration and willing to subscribe the commentator's "RSS". This was a totally new word to me and I kept it in mind and turned to browse the others blogs. As usual, I selected the articals I interested in and collected the personal information the author showed online. It took me a while to find his education background. The logical line is "studio\[on his website]-academic advisor'name\[ on connected link]-unit(the university/collage)\[on search engine]-checkout(position)\[on public page]". In this day, I equipped my laptop with RSS reader( irreader), not because I need it( I seldom browse pushed information.) but the notion of freely selecting and all in one got me. But if I decide to subcribe a small crowed website which didn't provide RSS and need cookies, I need to deployment and configuration on my own. From the guidance, I chose to deploy on my own laptop but failed in installing package.

I kept trying and searching related information. In this proceed I also perfected my RSS subscriptions and my own private website. But I still couldn't handle it. During this proceed I found another method to accomplish deployment and successed by almost one click. However, the configuration was totally strange to me and I gave up without hesitation. I turned to search related information I interested in. By chance I find [this](https://blog.csdn.net/hangvane123/article/details/113751387?ops_request_misc=&request_id=&biz_id=102&utm_term=vercel%E9%83%A8%E7%BD%B2%E7%8E%AF%E5%A2%83%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AEgitRSS&utm_medium=distribute.pc_search_result.none-task-blog-2~all~sobaiduweb~default-3-113751387.142^v35^experiment_2_v1&spm=1018.2226.3001.4187), I followed its steps but get stuck and asked the author for help( I also learned how to question, it in line with my imagnation):

您好，我最近在研究部署，初次接触npm，没有相关基础。看了您关于静态博客部署的文章，我研究了大半天，自我检查“配置已经正确，只是还未上传身份验证器”。我认为问题出在“合并package.json”，我的做法是将验证器仓库中我所没有的部分转移到我的仓库，没有做任何修改。我采取将验证器仓库中的所有文件转移到我的仓库（以不冲突为前提）但无效

我感到我的能力可能不足以解决，希望获得您的帮助，打扰了，多谢。

感谢关注，我这篇文章只是详细记录了手动搭建过程，如果你想按照此法，自建hexo博客的话，建议直接fork我做好的模板即可。具体操作可见readme

<https://github.com/hangvane/hexo-netlify-cms-vercel#usage>

用这个模板，你直接绑定好你的github相关验证密钥，去vercel部署一下就搞定了，不需要按照文章手动集成

In the morning I read [an author' acticals](http://www.ruanyifeng.com/survivor/) recommended in public RSS. I feel finally free from the stereotype of 211/985, and also know a example in reality by chance. That why I love ration, "when I understand, I am free of emtion." Then I kept building my private website and saw what I had made, read patiently about intp and 5W4. Not until the dawn did I find the author replied me. It's easy! But the method I chose helped me understand. I made a new start and succeeded. Then I decided to change the theme. But for unfamiliar about how to deal with the files on github, I made many mistakes and waste much time. Finally I succeeded in one and failed in another. I decided to find out the reason and asked:

您好，又打扰了。我想更换主题，next（<https://github.com/theme-next/hexo-theme-next>）成功，mellow（<https://github.com/codefine/hexo-theme-mellow>）失败（点入主页白屏）。我的做法是在根目录创建themes并修改根目录的_config.yml的theme。我想知道是不是next的包比较完善的原因？mellow本身缺少依赖，根据说明我进行如下操作 C:\Users\astro\git\danceloud\themes\mellow>npm install --save hexo-generator-search@2.1.1 hexo-generator-topindex@0.3.0 hexo-helper-qrcode@1.0.2 hexo-renderer-less@0.2.0

太多了我就不放了...最后是added 74 packages in 6s。感觉是失败了，请问有什么解决方法吗？谢谢。

I asked this question because I thought it is very similiar to the very first I met when deploy on my own laptop. I decide not to drag deeper for it's not much use (I tried to refining and the steps is too traivial to me for I still didn't handle how to edit locally...) ,and I don't know what to post and I just want to write on my private website for now. I will settle what I learnt and felt in these days, that's really a fruitful journey( not only knowledge but also opinion) and I' m happy. I am going to back on my routine.

GOOD-BYE.
