Everthing is a proceed.( I do change now, in this page large change will be record by delete line)

the key is always: don’t do more harm, instead of simply avoid consuming any animal products.

If I say I don’t care about food and I think killing lives is cruel, protecting the environment is important, why didn’t I make some changes? I feel shamed knowing how others keep it well. I didn’t make any efforts.

Now I understand I’m hypocritical, so let’s creat a new conception.

### Primitarian

“I rethink it, what I hate isn’t killing them, is the cheap, frozen meat, and all the other things contain meat, meat ball for example, they don’t feel like real meat. **So i only eat fresh meat then**, it’s also a way to cut the comsuption of meat. Cut the desire to always eat meat, eat meat by luck, like our ancient do.”

Let me clarify what is fresh meat in my opinion. When buy raw meat, no meat product, which means before cook add something else, even the sauce is not possible. Minced meat is ok but can’t be shaped like meat ball, 肥牛, no bacon. And for these meat, must be in fridge, no freezer. (just like vegetable) **No cooked meat, even in restaurant or canteen.** I don’t believe they will cook with fresh meat. Supermarket counter I choose to believe it, for chinese market it depends, observe the counter which is popular.

Animal product is ok like egg, butter or milk, as long as no additive.

Even in fresh I want to say no to duck and fish with small bones, just personal preference, and be more insistent.

### In finland

quite easy for schooltime, just eat at canteen and no worries about choosing. even easier for farmtime, and sensable. The problem is weekend (Sunday to be honest, and check the Saturday timetable) . I still have cereal and ~~rice~~ (leave it), so ~~breakfast~~ (no need) and staple is already decided. and some snacks such as ~~french chips~~. So for Sunday, my answer is fasting, but keep working out. The eating time should be around 14 and 18.

Kind of vegetarian, only eat meat when I cook myself, remember to check the local market for fresh meat. But milk and butter are ok.

No sauce, kind of western thing.

Can be meat and vegetarian one day.(just too boring to have the same dishes)

no sauce product, no plant oil, a piece of bread to get butter, no sweet plum

### To friend/family

Never avoid saying “我只吃新鲜的食物“ (only say it when asked), never avoid any social activities because of it. AA for that is possible, just order more vegetable. Barbecue it depends on the restaurant provide fresh meat or not.

Say no before meat be put into freezer. Watch it. Take care of food. Just eat the food out of freezer.

~~don’t eat animal product myself. In principle, it’s ok to consume the animal products before they are wasted (e.g. throw away), but if someone wants to test me and leave some food on purpose that’s kind of annoying and I will say no. Probably my parents will do it so let’s see. And it should also be ok to consume the dish which has the animal product, as long as they are divided clearly~~

~~. (e.g. meat sauce is impossible)~~

When order in the restaurant, only order non-animal products ~~(It’s not very friendly in China but just try my best). Mistake is tolerated just keep in mind and never again.~~

I should ask for some beans/tofu as the alternative source of protein.

Avoid strong flavor.

Never avoid saying ”我不吃早餐“ “我周日禁食“

### In school

No milktea, no “tea”. No delivered food (because of the one-time packing box and tableware) Always choose the local market for ~~vegetable~~ and fruit, make sure they are fresh and eatable. Pindodo or Meituan for potato is possible.

In dorm the design is no kitchen so keep it simple: ~~only salad~~, fruits, nuts and potato. never add anymore cookers. Prepare some bean powder for breakfast. And always keep some drinkable water!!! DON’T COOK MEAT IN DORM.

In canteen the fruite plate is possible but only in busy days. Always have lunch there, that’s a place designed to provide food for students. And prepare dinner myself. So the time is around 12 and 19.

as reference:

breakfast: raw egg, bean milk

lunch: half rice, vegetable, eggs( don’t eat fired too much), bean products

after lunch: fruits

dinner: avocado, coconut oil, potato

snack: nuts

### To other non-food product

Avoid animal products instead of chemical products. I’m a science student so I know the scam of organic products (especially in China). Chemistry is innovation. People just use the rules but remember never overuse it to break the balance. I don’t believe in any organic products but willing to find some natural existance as alternative, but probably not in school because it must not so convenient for lack of preservative.

Avoid using too many products (thanks my laziness I don’t use much before, such as conditioner). Already did a good job and just use them less, be more natural. Body is a system and believe in it. For body wash, towel and soap are enough. For hair, shampoo. For teeth, toothpaste. That’s all. And always bring the bottle and reusable bag to prevent plastic pollution.

~~Oily product is the biggest problem (just in winter for me, and in south it’s shorter), for hand and body, let’s just try plant oil.~~ I will use animal oil as lotion.

All above are consumables and I only focus on consumables. (Sometimes you just need to decide and no need to clarify, thanks that I think a lot I always have a decision). For example, clothes, they are not consumables to me so leather coat/shoes is possible. They are just better than other materials. (They are organic that’s funny.)

Primitarian

17.3

Creat notion page for it.

Still have: beef, butter, sheep oil

From now

* Strengthern the exercising 7

18.3

Check for Fat for Fuel (remember to update knowledges by checking the website, tbh i don’t like the style of the website, too commercial and seems make himself a symbol). Improve my notion page.

Let’s do the first try this noon. But dinner unavoidably eating my own cooked food.

It’s not so bad!! I feel natural and fresh! And no need to make choices… At dinner i eat the cheap meat but it doesnt feel so good anymore… hope i can get rid of it soon…

19.3

Still improve the notion page.

If there are not many people, check all the choices in canteen.

We do have a lot of choices. No garllic oil.

I rethink it, what I hate isnt killing them, is the cheap, frozen meat, and all the other things contain meat, meat ball for example. So i only eat fresh meat then, it’s also a way to cut the comsuption of meat. Cut the desire to always eat meat, eat meat by luck, like our ancient do.

Change the notion page, don't really have many adjustments.

20.3

If have two meal at napa, second meal can be meat including. I really want to have curry sauce:(

Had some meatball with curry sauce, not bad! But the meatball doesn’t taste so real( even the one in my family is same so probably I shouldn’t ask for more)

21.3

edited in 22.3, forgot to write about it yesterday. Bean soup for lunch and Bean soup with bacon for dinner.

22.3

break the rule, just eat one meal at napa but chose the meat sauce (not bad), just the sauce looks much better than the vegetarian one, but dinner just have the cereal so it's not so bad.

23.3

~~Go to napa at 12.~~

really don't want to go there just for lunch, so maybe skip the lunch and have french chips for dinner, not so healthy but still in procedure. forgot to mention that the strong "american" in that book. Found that sometimes the vege food in napa is really no so good, maybe I can trust the fresh meat in all the restaurant? But I should't have that smoked meat bean soup yesterday. But like soy sauce that's also a kind of flavor. I'm confusing.

24.3

fasting day

Still eat a meal, self cook with lettuce tomato yogurt and pork.

Still dinner and ate all the meat…

And some chocolate after 8… when you have something to do you just cant focus on what you eat…

25.3

end. Too troublesome and a least I gain some health knowledges. I will be more careful in the future but not in this way.
