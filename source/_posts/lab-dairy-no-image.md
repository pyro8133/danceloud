Part Ⅰ

* 30.1 132

    Friendly teacher, classmate and familier lab enviroment. Beautiful
    roots under microscope(next time I will try to record them in my note).
    Undersandable work with clear target. The content is very specific, felt
    peaceful and relaxed when clean them. I confirm again that I like
    specific figures instead of stories, while abstract conceptions instead
    of statistic.

    Samples from Savukoski and one Calluna vulgaris one Empetrum nigrum
    today.

    The Cal is clean itself( there was something I thought would be
    fur(black, very thin) so I picked them out, then I found some of them
    surrounded so close to the root body, so I thought they were dead hair
    roots, but didn’t ask the teacher). The mine was white to yellow and so
    many hair roots, perfect fibrous root, but the other(older and maybe
    from Oulu?) were small pieces and not that much hair roots. Mosh need to
    be picked out(but how you know it’s a mosh, so we need the main root),
    it’s obvious that you should make sure the roots from the aimed
    plant.(e.g.PCR)

    The case of Emp is more complicated. Similiar structure to
    root(branches?) but without hair root so should be picked out\[1]. Soil
    so close to the root makes it hard to divide them. My finger is gentle
    but hard to be accurate, the knife is sharp but accurate. Although I
    have studied pedology and know how complicate it formed, I still wanted
    to see it as a simple material, but I kept remind myself: the soil isn’t
    just soil, it’s from dead stones, plants and so many things. If you want
    to divide soil and root, it will make the root into smaller pieces, pick
    or not? The amount counts(e.g.DNA) but it would take a lot of time.

    The most interesting part is the Piloderma, which I thought firstly
    was mosh(no way! wrong location and wrong appearance) then fungus. Then
    I got the explanation, it’s (ecto)mycorrhiza(=symbiosis) between fungus
    and a plant, growing on the tips of the (pine) root(maybe also on
    branches if it get the chance?cause today the teacher said it isn’t a
    root, see above \[1])(just outside or also inside? I don’t remember
    clearly,if it’s inside it’s kind of invada), that’s really an
    interesting pheomenon. And it grows naturally on the root, so it form a
    micro-environment for the root I think.
    
* 26.2 130

  1. fungi is also inside. 
  2. Entangled with many impurities（mainly soil chunks）.
  3. something look like eggs of bug.
       
* 27.2 125

    The fungi is possibly not totally the same specie as the first day, because it’s white instead of yellow, staying almost a month in +5℃ environment.

    There is the hard, spherical little thing attched on root and removable.(over one time appeared)
    
* 28.2 122.5

    have a new one(Cal), still with white fungi.
    
* 29.2 118

    finish the new one. The problem is, we don’t have a clear standard:

  1. how many grams do we need to collect;
  2. what is “clear”.
* 01.3 111.5

    Two(Vac and Emp), Vac without moss or branches, the soil is less( Compared to Emp). It might because the collector, the type of root, the habitat of species). Both without fungi( but found the thin, black roots might be fungi, Vac)
    
* 18.3 109.5

    Emp, quite a simple sample, but has a lot of moss so I took photo of them, hope I can identify them in the future.
    
* 19.3 104.5

    Three( Cal Vac Vac), remeber to record which phenomenen happens on which specie, and try to identify the three species). something growing on the main root looks like leaves, maybe four new spieces of moss. The young roots are easier to turn black and be soft. Probably because the ? system isn’t mature. A lot of eggs like pieces. The difference between soft and tough roots. Yellow fungi again. White fungi. Something like sponge. Many attached black little balls.

    Ps: Borrowed two books to identify.
    
* 21.3  99.5

    (Emp Cal) a lot of moss and some new speices, attached as pictures and identification as comments, still find some new phenomenes, the skin with fungi, the roots envolopped by fungi and moss, a lichen liked thing, a green branch, a strange, fungi-like roots, the branch which the tips are envolopped by fungi( sometimes not a worm with its transparent body, envolopped but also strech),  A really messed up sample and the difference between new root and old root.
    

Part Ⅱ

* 22.3 94.5

    Desch spiece. Just give up the bad sample, the mycorrhiza and the roots can’t be divided.
    
* 24.3 90

    today we have someone who has the hobbies of mushroom or fungi visiting the lab, that’s the most crowded day here, I see the teacher Ms. Ruostalainen totally changed, be more active and introduce others the projects in the lab with confidence, in the end she showed me how to use the key. The people who are interested in the lab has the chance to visit the lab without much border and they have the chance to study in the university freely. That’s a very good cycle I think, that’s a really ideal world.
